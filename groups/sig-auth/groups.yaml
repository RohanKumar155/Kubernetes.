groups:

  #
  # Mailing lists
  #
  # Each group here represents a mailing list for the SIG or its subprojects,
  # and is not intended to govern access to infrastructure
  #

  #
  # k8s-staging write access for SIG-owned subprojects
  #
  # Each group here represents privileged access to a staging project,
  # allowing the members to directly write to GCS and GCR within the
  # project, as well as trigger Cloud Build within the project. Ideally
  # this level access is used solely for troubleshooting purposes.
  #
  # Membership should correspond roughly to subproject owners for the set of
  # subproject artifacts being stored in a given staging project

  # Each group here governs access to one GCS bucket. Ideally this level of
  # access is used solely for troubleshooting purposes.
  #
  # Membership should correspond roughly to subproject owners for the set of
  # subproject artifacts being stored in the GCS bucket

  #
  # k8s-infra owners for sig-owned subprojects
  #
  # Each group here represents highly privileged access to kubernetes project
  # infrastructure owned or managed by this SIG. A high level of trust is
  # required for membership in these groups.

  # RBAC groups:
  # - grant access to the `namespace-user` role for a single namespace on the `aaa` cluster
  # - must have WhoCanViewMemberShip: "ALL_MEMBERS_CAN_VIEW"
